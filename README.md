# Useless Calculator

This project was made in Java Swing and Eclipse for my assignment. **Please don't**:

- Submit a pull request
- Talk about this program in your thanksgiving party, **like seriously talk about politics instead**.
- Use this calculator unironically. *spoiler: it can only add, the design sucks and you have to extract it and run it manually just to know two plus two*
- Remind me of this project
- Touch the source code (unless your my teacher reviewing the code)

By the way, the only reason I wrote *this* before running:

```
git init
git add . 
git commit -m "don't use this"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/theawesomestnathan/useless-calc.git
git push -u origin main
```
is because Markdown is fun and I enjoy writing in it.
